# ILI9341
Library for ILI9341 (designed for STM32F410 use)

Library checked with tjctm24024-spi display. My display doesn't response for read commands so I don't included them in libraries (I cannot check if they work correctly)

Library based on martnak/STM32-ILI9341 : https://github.com/martnak/STM32-ILI9341
